# JavaFX User Interface Homework

## Overview
This project implements a simple JavaFX-based user interface with a top bar menu that provides four functionalities: displaying the current date and time, exporting text to a file, changing the background color, and exiting the program.

## Features
1. **Date & Time Display**
   - Selecting this option shows the current date and time in a text field in the format `yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss`.
   
2. **Export Text**
   - The content of the text field is saved to a file named `log.txt`. The file is created or overwritten in the current directory.

3. **Change Background Color**
   - Selecting this option changes the background color of the interface to a random hue of green.

4. **Exit**
   - Closes the application.

## How It Works
The application uses a top bar menu with a dropdown (or menu bar) containing the four menu items. JavaFX event handlers are used to implement the functionalities, including generating random colors, formatting date/time, and writing to files.

## Running the Application
1. Compile the JavaFX application using your favorite IDE or command line.
2. Launch the application, and interact with the menu options.

## Requirements
- JavaFX SDK
- Java Development Kit (JDK)

Enjoy your new JavaFX user interface!
